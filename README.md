# 🏥 AI Health Assistant

## 📌 Project Overview
The **AI Health Assistant** is a conversational agent designed to help users with basic health-related queries.  
It leverages **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning** to understand user input, provide possible symptom-based insights, and offer general wellness guidance.  

⚠️ **Disclaimer:** This assistant is **not a substitute for professional medical advice**. It is intended only for educational and informational purposes.

## ✨ Features
- 🩺 **Symptom Checker** → Suggests possible conditions based on user input  
- 💬 **Conversational Interface** → Understands health-related questions  
- 📚 **Medical Knowledge Base** → Preloaded dataset of symptoms & conditions  
- 🔍 **Search & Recommendation** → Provides self-care tips and advice  
- 🌐 **Deployment Ready** → Can be run as a web app (Flask/Streamlit)

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Clone the repo

git clone https://github.com/your-username/health-assistant.git
cd health-assistant

2. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the app

For Streamlit:

streamlit run app.py


For Flask:

python app.py

4. Use the Health Assistant

Type symptoms like:

I have a headache and fever


The assistant will suggest possible conditions and remedies.

📊 Model Workflow

>Input Processing → User symptom query

>NLP Preprocessing → Tokenization, stopword removal, vectorization

>Model Prediction → Maps symptoms to possible conditions

>Response Generation → Returns advice or recommendation

📌 Future Enhancements

>Integrate with LLMs (GPT-based) for advanced conversational ability

>Add real-time API integration with medical databases (e.g., WHO, CDC)

>Build a mobile app version
